Flask Founder-Investor Matcher App – Explanation

This web app helps match startup founders with investors based on industry and startup stage. It lets users:

1. Upload two CSV files – one for founders, one for investors.

2. Select a founder from a dropdown list.
3. Find investors whose preferences align with the founder’s industry and stage.
4. View results on a simple webpage (without showing a match score).
